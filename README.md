# Swinging-Atwood-Machine
Study of the Swinging-Atwood's machine dinamics with Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Numerical and graphical simulation of the chaotic system, computation of Lyapunov's exponent of the configuration for a thousand values of mass ratio.

It is used MATLAB for numerical solution of differential equation (Runge-Kutta algorithm) and for computation of Lyapunov's exponent.
It is used Processing for numerical and graphical simulation of the chaotic system.

The report, that is written in Latex, is avaiable in Italian-version and soon in English-version.

Project conceived in the context of PAF extracurricular course held by prof. Franco Dalfovo at the University of Trento, a.y. 2017/2018.
